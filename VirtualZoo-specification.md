## Virtual Zoo

_Please ensure you read and understand the entire document before undertaking this assignment. If you require
clarification on the specification within, please seek this as soon as possible._

### Submission and Assessment

The assignment comprises five tasks that each will require you to complete a series of steps to construct a Java program
that adheres to the described specification. Remember to analyse the problem as necessary and design a solution that
suits the deliverables. You need to determine the structures you will use. This is an application that will reuse
elements significantly and as such your development should consider this. Your program should also follow good code 
writing practices, styles and conventions. This including aspects such as the appropriate use of indentation and 
white-space, meaningful identifier names, suitable comments, minimal code duplication, privacy modifiers, etc.

At the conclusion of each task, you will be
asked to address several questions and report on the approach you have taken to complete the steps. 
Your answers for each question should typically consist of one or two paragraphs.
Treat this as a professional activity, so your report should be presented in a manner suitable for a professional audience. 

You will be awarded marks for the level of completion of your program (including answers to the questions in each
section). This assignment will be marked out of a total of 100 marks as follows:

| TASK                      |     | MARKS |
|:--------------------------|----:|:-----:|
| Task 1 (Animal Class)     |   : |  15   |
| Task 2 (Animal Selection) |   : |  20   |
| Task 3 (Item Selection)   |   : |  15   |
| Task 4 (Week Cycle)       |   : |  10   |
| Task 5 (Animal Species)   |   : |  20   |
| Good Code Practices       |   : |  20   |

Development should be consistent with the _IntelliJ_ environment and Java version 17. Any issues running a program developed in another IDE 
or on a different Java version will result in a penalty of 50% of your grade.

### Submission

You will need to submit both a zipped version of your project and your report, as a single PDF document, on Canvas by 4pm,
Thursday Week 12 (June 1st).

### Academic Integrity

As required by Flinders University policy, a report on your submission will be generated by the TurnItIn text-matching
software, which compares your work with a large body of material and generates a report of any similarities. Each
student should carefully ensure that the work they submit is their own and that any material directly sourced from the
work of others is properly acknowledged.

### Specification

You have been approached by a local zoo to help develop a software application that can be used to train their employees 
about the various needs and costs associated with different animal species. The application should be text-based, and 
operate according to the following procedure:

1. Ask the user to specify how many animals are present in the zoo.
2. Ask the user to specify a unique name for each animal, as well as its species (Tiger, Elephant, Rhino, Panda or Monkey).
3. Simulate a virtual week (starting from Monday and ending on Sunday) where each day the following occurs:
   - Print the current weekday, and the status of each animal. Each animal's status is represented by three properties (Hunger, Thirst and Boredom). Each of these properties has an initial value of 50.
   - Ask the user to select one of three items (Food, Water or Toy) for each animal in the zoo. This choice will update each animal's properties, as well as the week's total cost, according to the chart below. The same item cannot be given to an animal two days in a row. The value for any status property cannot drop below 0.
   - If an animal's hunger, thirst or boredom value is greater than 100, then the animal will die. If this happens, an additional $1000 will be added to the total zoo cost. The program should not ask the user to specify an item for dead animals on any future days.
4. After a full week has passed, the total cost of looking after all animals' during the week will be printed.

| Animal       | Food                                                    | Water                                                  | Toy                                                    |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tiger**    | -30 Hunger<br/>+15 Thirst<br/>+15 Boredom<br/>cost $30  | +15 Hunger<br/>-30 Thirst<br/>+15 Boredom<br/>cost $20 | +15 Hunger<br/>+15 Thirst<br/>-30 Boredom<br/>cost $40 |
| **Elephant** | -50 Hunger<br/>+30 Thirst<br/>+20 Boredom<br/>cost $100 | +20 Hunger<br/>-50 Thirst<br/>+30 Boredom<br/>cost $40 | +30 Hunger<br/>+10 Thirst<br/>-40 Boredom<br/>cost $75 |
| **Rhino**    | -25 Hunger<br/>+5 Thirst<br/>+25 Boredom<br/>cost $50   | +5 Hunger<br/>-25 Thirst<br/>+25 Boredom<br/>cost $50  | +20 Hunger<br/>+20 Thirst<br/>-50 Boredom<br/>cost $20 |
| **Panda**    | -25 Hunger<br/>+15 Thirst<br/>+15 Boredom<br/>cost $60  | +40 Hunger<br/>-80 Thirst<br/>+10 Boredom<br/>cost $5  | +40 Hunger<br/>+15 Thirst<br/>-40 Boredom<br/>cost $10 |
| **Monkey**   | -30 Hunger<br/>+10 Thirst<br/>+10 Boredom<br/>cost $5   | +10 Hunger<br/>-40 Thirst<br/>+10 Boredom<br/>cost $5  | +10 Hunger<br/>+10 Thirst<br/>-15 Boredom<br/>cost $15 |

your program should also be able to handle the following situations:
1. The user enters an invalid number of animals (either a non-integer value or a negative integer). If this happens you should tell the user that their input is invalid and then ask them again.
2. The user enters a name for an animal that has already been given to a previous animal (i.e., a non-unique name). If this happens you should tell the user that this name has already been taken and then ask them again. Please be aware that name uniqueness should be case-sensitive, so "ANDY" and "andy" are two different names.
3. The user enters an invalid animal or item name. If this happens you should tell the user that their input is invalid and then ask them again.
4. The user enters an animal or item name that contains upper and/or lower case letters. For example, "TIGER", "Tiger" and "tiger" are all valid animal names and should be accepted by your program.
5. The user enters the same item for a given animal two days in a row. If this happens you should tell the user that they cannot give the same item as yesterday and then ask them again.

Example output could be as follows (user input in <mark>**bold highlighted**</mark> text)

## Tasks

While the steps described below should be completed sequentially you should also pause during your development to test
recent changes and fix problems as they arise. Don’t leave testing until you complete Task 5.

### Task 1 – Animal Class

Take some time to read through the existing code and the comments. The program's
main method is located inside the `VirtualZooDriver` class. Running the provided program without any modifications or additions
will result in the following output

<pre>
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     Welcome to the Virtual Zoo!                      |
|   Use this application to simulate running a zoo with many animals   |
|           This program is intended for zoo employees only            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre>

You will **not** need to change the `VirtualZooDriver` class, however you will be adding code to the `VirtualZoo` class. 
You will also be creating your own classes. 

Your first task is to write the `Animal` class that defines the relevant functionality and properties that all 
animals have. 

This class should include the following string instance variables:
- <samp>**name**</samp>
- <samp>**species**</samp>

This class should also include the following integer instance variables, each of which has an initial value of 50:
- <samp>**hunger**</samp>
- <samp>**thirst**</samp>
- <samp>**boredom**</samp>

Write a constructor for the `Animal` class, that takes in two string parameters that define the animal's name and species.
Create getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying all instance variables in the `Animal` class.
Create a method called <samp>**isDead()**</samp> that returns a boolean indicating if the animal is dead. An animal
is dead if any of its properties (hunger, thirst or boredom) are above 100.

Copy the following <samp>**toString()**</samp> method into the `Animal` class:
<pre>
public String toString()
{
    String statusMessage = isDead() ? "Name = " + getName() + " (Dead)\n" : "Name = " + getName() + "\n";
    statusMessage += "Species = " + getSpecies() + "\n";
    statusMessage += "Hunger = " + getHunger() + "\n";
    statusMessage += "Thirst = " + getThirst() + "\n";
    statusMessage += "Boredom = " + getBoredom() + "\n";
    return statusMessage;
}
</pre>

You can test your code for this task by running the following statements:

<pre>
Animal myDog = new Animal("Rover", "Rhino");
Animal myCat = new Animal("Fluffy", "Tiger");
myDog.setBoredom(30);
myDog.setHunger(70);
myCat.setName("Mittens");
myCat.setThirst(110);
System.out.println(myDog);
System.out.println(myCat);
</pre>

Which should give the following output:

<pre>
Name = Rover
Species = Rhino
Hunger = 70
Thirst = 50
Boredom = 30

Name = Mittens (Dead)
Species = Tiger
Hunger = 50
Thirst = 110
Boredom = 50

</pre>

---

#### REPORT TASK

Answer the following questions:

1. What issues (if any) did you encounter with the program?
2. Describe any issues with the code as initially downloaded.
3. If any issues were present, what did you have to fix in order to compile and run the code successfully in IntelliJ?
4. Explain how the first line of the provided toString() method works.

---  

### Task 2 – Animal Selection

Your second task is to write the code that asks the user to specify how many animals are present in the zoo, as well as 
the name and species of each animal.

A <samp>**Scanner**</samp> object <samp>**scan**</samp> has already been defined for your needs inside the `VirtualZoo` class.
Make use of the Scanner operations to capture the user input.

You will need to implement the following four methods inside the `VirtualZoo` class:

### **askNumberAnimals()**

This method should ask the user "How many animals are at your zoo?", and then return their response as an integer. 
This method should also verify that the response provided by the user is a positive integer. If the value provided is 
not an integer, print the message "Please enter a valid number of animals". If the value provided is a negative integer, 
print the message "Please enter a positive number of animals". The method should repeatedly perform these instructions 
until the user enters a positive integer response. For example, calling this method using the statement:

<pre>
System.out.println("Number of animals = " + askNumberAnimals());
</pre>

Could give the following output (user input in <mark>**bold highlighted**</mark> text):

<pre>
How many animals are at your zoo?
<mark><b>three</b></mark>
Please enter a valid number of animals
How many animals are at your zoo?
<mark><b>-5</b></mark>
Please enter a positive number of animals
How many animals are at your zoo?
<mark><b>Lots of animals</b></mark>
Please enter a valid number of animals
How many animals are at your zoo?
<mark><b>13</b></mark>
Number of animals = 13
</pre>



### **askAnimalName(int id)**

This method should ask the user "What is the name of animal #X?" (where X represents the value of the integer parameter
<samp>**id**</samp>) and then return their response as a string.
This method should also verify that the name provided by the user is unique and has not been used for any previous animal.
One way to do this is to define a static ArrayList<String> variable inside the `VirtualZoo` class that stores all previously entered names.
If the name provided by the user is present in this ArrayList, then you know that the name has already been used for a previous animal.
If the name specified by the user has already been used previously, print the message "That name is already taken". 
This method should repeatedly perform these instructions until the user enters a unique name for the animal. Please 
remember that animal names as case-sensitive.
For example, calling this method using the statements:

<pre>
System.out.println("Animal 1 name = " + askAnimalName(1));
System.out.println("Animal 2 name = " + askAnimalName(2));
</pre>

could give the following output (user input in <mark>**bold highlighted**</mark> text):

<pre>
What is the name of animal #1?
<mark><b>Rover</b></mark>
Animal 1 name = Rover
What is the name of animal #2?
<mark><b>Rover</b></mark>
That name is already taken
What is the name of animal #2?
<mark><b>Mittens</b></mark>
Animal 2 name = Mittens
</pre>


### **askAnimalSpecies(String name)**

This method should ask the user "What is the species of X?" (where X represents the value of the string parameter
<samp>**name**</samp>) and then return their response as an Animal object.
This method should also verify that the species provided by the user is one of the five valid animal species (Tiger, 
Elephant, Rhino, Panda or Monkey). If the species specified by the user is not valid, print the message "That is not a 
valid species". This method should repeatedly perform these instructions until the user enters a valid species for the animal. 
Please remember that animal species inputs should be case-insensitive, so the inputs "Tiger", "tiger" and "TIGER" are all valid.
Once a valid species has been specified, the method should create an Animal object using the previously specified 
constructor inside the `Animal` class. When doing this, the species parameter should always be specified with the first 
letter in uppercase and the remaining letters in lowercase.
For example, calling this method using the statement:


<pre>
System.out.println(askAnimalSpecies("Rover"));
</pre>

could give the following output (user input in <mark>**bold highlighted**</mark> text):

<pre>
What is the species of Rover?
<mark><b>pig</b></mark>
That is not a valid species
What is the species of Rover?
<mark><b>SNAKE</b></mark>
That is not a valid species
What is the species of Rover?
<mark><b>RHINO</b></mark>
Name = Rover
Species = Rhino
Hunger = 50
Thirst = 50
Boredom = 50
</pre>



### **animalSelection()**

This method should ask the user how many animals are present in the zoo, as well as
the name and species of each animal. This can be done be calling each of the three methods described above 
(<samp>**askNumberAnimals**</samp>, <samp>**askAnimalName**</samp>, <samp>**askAnimalSpecies**</samp>) to
get the required information from the user. This method should then return an arraylist of <samp>**Animal**</samp> objects, each of which
represents an animal that is present in the zoo.

For example, calling this method using the statements:

<pre>
ArrayList&lt;Animal> allZooAnimals = animalSelection();
System.out.println("\n" + allZooAnimals.get(1).getName());
</pre>

Could give the following output (user input in <mark>**bold highlighted**</mark> text):

<pre>
How many animals are at your zoo?
<mark><b>three</b></mark>
Please enter a valid number of animals
How many animals are at your zoo?
<mark><b>-5</b></mark>
Please enter a positive number of animals
How many animals are at your zoo?
<mark><b>3</b></mark>

What is the name of animal #1?
<mark><b>Andy</b></mark>
What is the species of Andy?
<mark><b>panda</b></mark>
What is the name of animal #2?
<mark><b>Andy</b></mark>
That name is already taken
What is the name of animal #2?
<mark><b>HENRY</b></mark>
What is the species of HENRY?
<mark><b>hippo</b></mark>
That is not a valid species
What is the species of HENRY?
<mark><b>RHINO</b></mark>
What is the name of animal #3?
<mark><b>tony</b></mark>
What is the species of tony?
<mark><b>tiger</b></mark>

HENRY
</pre>

---

#### REPORT TASK

Answer the following questions:

1. How did you ensure that the user provided a positive integer for the number of animals?
2. How did you ensure that the user provided a unique name for each animal?
3. How did you ensure that the user provided a valid species for each animal?

---  

### Task 3 - Item Selection

Your third task is to write the code that asks the user to select what item they want to give to a specific animal, 
and then apply any effects that this has on the animal and week's total cost.

To begin with, define a static integer variable called <samp>**totalCost**</samp> inside the `VirtualZoo` class. This variable will be used 
to store to accumulative cost of looking after all animals in the zoo throughout the week. 
Create getter and setter methods for accessing this variable. 

Next, define three methods inside the `Animal` class called <samp>**giveFood()**</samp>, <samp>**giveWater()**</samp> and <samp>**giveToy()**</samp>.
For the time being, implement these methods such that calling each of them has the following effect:
- calling <samp>**giveFood()**</samp> decreases <samp>**hunger**</samp> by 30, increases <samp>**thirst**</samp> by 15, increases <samp>**boredom**</samp> by 15, increases <samp>**totalCost**</samp> by 30.
- calling <samp>**giveWater()**</samp> increases <samp>**hunger**</samp> by 15, decreases <samp>**thirst**</samp> by 30, increases <samp>**boredom**</samp> by 15, increases <samp>**totalCost**</samp> by 20.
- calling <samp>**giveToy()**</samp> increases <samp>**hunger**</samp> by 15, increases <samp>**thirst**</samp> by 15, decreases <samp>**boredom**</samp> by 30, increases <samp>**totalCost**</samp> by 40.

You should notice that this follows the same status property modifications that were defined for the Tiger species in the complete tasks specifications.

When decreasing the <samp>**hunger**</samp>, <samp>**thirst**</samp> or <samp>**boredom**</samp> properties of an animal, the value for the property cannot drop 
below 0. For example, calling <samp>**giveFood()**</samp> on an animal with a current <samp>**hunger**</samp> property value of 5, will reduce the
animals hunger to 0 but no lower.

You can test your code for this by running the following statements:

<pre>
Animal myPet = new Animal("Tony", "Tiger");
myPet.giveFood();
System.out.println(myPet);
myPet.giveFood();
System.out.println(myPet);
myPet.giveWater();
System.out.println(myPet);
myPet.giveToy();
System.out.println(myPet);
System.out.println(VirtualZoo.getTotalCost());
</pre>

Which should give the following output:

<pre>
Name = Tony
Species = Tiger
Hunger = 20
Thirst = 65
Boredom = 65

Name = Tony
Species = Tiger
Hunger = 0
Thirst = 80
Boredom = 80

Name = Tony
Species = Tiger
Hunger = 15
Thirst = 50
Boredom = 95

Name = Tony
Species = Tiger
Hunger = 30
Thirst = 65
Boredom = 65

120
</pre>

You will also need to implement the following method inside the `VirtualZoo` class:

### **askItem(Animal animal)**

This method should ask the user "What item would you like to give to X?" (where X represents the name of the <samp>**animal**</samp> parameter).
This method should also verify that the item specified by the user is one of the three valid items (Food,
Water or Toy), and that this item was not the same as the previous item that was given to <samp>**animal**</samp>. If the item specified by the user is not valid, print the message "That is not a
valid item". If the item specified by the user is the same as the most recent previous item that was given to <samp>**animal**</samp>, then print the 
message "You cannot give the same item as yesterday". This method should repeatedly perform these instructions until the user enters a valid response.
Please remember that item name inputs should be case-insensitive, so the inputs "Food", "food" and "FOOD" are all valid.
Once a valid item has been specified, the method should call either the <samp>**giveFood()**</samp>, <samp>**giveWater()**</samp> or <samp>**giveToy()**</samp> method
on <samp>**animal**</samp>, depending on the item that was selected.
If giving an item to an animal has resulted in its death, add 1000 to the <samp>**totalCost**</samp> variable and print the 
message "X has died" (where X represents the name of the Animal parameter <samp>**animal**</samp>).

You can test your code for this task by running the following statements (user input in <mark>**bold highlighted**</mark> text):

<pre>
Animal myPet = new Animal("Tony", "Tiger");
askItem(myPet);
System.out.println(myPet);
askItem(myPet);
System.out.println(myPet);
System.out.println(VirtualZoo.getTotalCost());
</pre>

Which should give the following output:

<pre>
What item would you like to give to Tony?
<mark><b>toast</b></mark>
That is not a valid item
What item would you like to give to Tony?
<mark><b>FOOD</b></mark>
Name = Tony
Species = Tiger
Hunger = 20
Thirst = 65
Boredom = 65

What item would you like to give to Tony?
<mark><b>MORE FOOD</b></mark>
That is not a valid item
What item would you like to give to Tony?
<mark><b>food</b></mark>
You cannot give the same item as yesterday
What item would you like to give to Tony?
<mark><b>water</b></mark>
Name = Tony
Species = Tiger
Hunger = 35
Thirst = 35
Boredom = 80

50
</pre>

#### REPORT TASK

Answer the following questions:

1. How did you check whether an item specified by the user for an animal was different from the most recent item that was given to that animal.
2. The zoo has asked you to modify the program so that an item can only be given to an animal if it was not the same as either of the previous two items it was given. How would you need to change the code to achieve this?

### Task 4 - Week Cycle

Your fourth task is to write the code that will cycle through all 7 days of the week (Monday-Sunday), and each day
print the status of all animals in the zoo and ask the user to select what item they want to give to each animal.

You will need to implement the following method inside the `VirtualZoo` class:

### **weekCycle(ArrayList&lt;Animal> zooAnimals)**

This method should carry out the following set of operations for each day of the week (7 days in total).
- Print the message "The current day is X", where X should be the current day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
  Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday)
- Print the status of each animal in <samp>**zooAnimals**</samp>. This can be done by calling the <samp>**toString()**</samp> method 
  on each animal in the ArrayList.
- Ask the user what item they want to give to each animal in <samp>**zooAnimals**</samp> that is still alive, using the previously 
  defined <samp>**askItem(Animal animal)**</samp> method. The user should not be asked to give an item to any animal that has died. 

Once the week has concluded, the method should print the message "Total week cost = $X", where X is the value of the
<samp>**totalCost**</samp> static variable inside the `VirtualZoo` class.

You can test your code for this task by replacing <samp>**beginSimulation()**</samp> method in the `VirtualZoo` class with the following 
updated version:

<pre>
public void beginSimulation() {
   displayWelcome();
   ArrayList&lt;Animal> zooAnimals = animalSelection();
   weekCycle(zooAnimals);
}
</pre>

This will allow you to run the program from the `VirtualZooDriver` class and complete the application from start
to finish, with the exception that all animals will be treated the same regardless of their species.

Your output might look something like the following (user input in <mark>**bold highlighted**</mark> text):

<pre>
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     Welcome to the Virtual Zoo!                      |
|   Use this application to simulate running a zoo with many animals   |
|           This program is intended for zoo employees only            |

#### REPORT TASK

Answer the following questions:

1. Describe what difference having the <samp>**totalCost**</samp> variable as static makes to your program.
2. Describe what changes need to be made to your program in order for the user to manage multiple zoos with their own
   separate animals and costs.

---  

### Task 5 - Animal Species

Your final tasks is to implement the different effects and costs that the available items have on each animal species.
First convert the <samp>**Animal**</samp> class into an abstract class, and the methods <samp>**giveFood()**</samp>, <samp>**giveWater()**</samp> and
<samp>**giveToy()**</samp> into abstract methods. Create five new classes called `Tiger`, `Elephant`, `Rhino`, `Panda` and `Monkey`,
which extend the `Animal` abstract class. Each of these new classes should override the <samp>**giveFood()**</samp>, <samp>**giveWater()**</samp> and
<samp>**giveToy()**</samp> abstract methods with their own species-specific implementations (as defined in the original Specification 
table). You will also need to modify the <samp>**askAnimalSpecies**</samp> method in the `VirtualZoo` class to call the constructors of these 
five new classes.

Once this final task has been completed, your program should produce the complete example output provided with the 
original specifications.

---

#### REPORT TASK

Answer the following questions:

1. Is there an alternative way that we could determine the species of an Animal object without
   calling the <samp>**getSpecies()**</samp> method?
2. What impact does making the `Animal` class an abstract class have on our program?
3. What difference would making the `Animal` class an interface, instead of an abstract class, have on our program?
4. The zoo has asked you to write a Graphical User Interface for the program you have written. Could it be used as
   is, or would you need to rewrite parts of the code to accomplish this? Discuss and explain.
